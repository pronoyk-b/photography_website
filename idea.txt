i want to create a photography website for me. 


** things to consider 
1. we are two photographers (Anuvab Saha as Videographer, Pronoy Kumar Biswas as Photographer)
2. We shoot Rice ceremony, Wedding, Pre-wedding, Model
3. for all types of photography, there should be one separate page with custom style (for Rice ceremony use a theme that can align with kids and children, for Wedding style use svg underline image kolka style, For wedding style use a style that suits prewedding aesthetic, for model photoshoot use bold style that goes with model photoshoot.)
4. homepage should have header, footer with nav bar and hamburger style that is responsible for website's responsiveness. 
5. in the about us section, for each of us, use a placeholder image (images folder) with animation that mimics the style of writing with short description.
6. in the mid of the home page use slideshow (from slideshow_homepage folder's image) in landscape mode
7. below the slideshow, there should be card type of option for each type of photography that will redirect to respective html pages for corresponding types of photography.
8. in the home page, look and feel must be aesthetic, minimal and lucrative and eye pleasing.
9. use html, css, javascript, bootstrap only to create this.
10. for all type of images, use placeholder image for now.
11. for each type of photography page, there should be 2 video section that will play a video from "videos" folder
12. use smooth animation everywhere.
